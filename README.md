EKOS — Enterprise Knowledge OS

A Multimodal, AI-powered Search & Intelligence Layer for Modern Teams

Welcome to EKOS, an experimental platform that brings all organizational knowledge into one unified, intelligent search experience. This project aims to solve a problem every team faces today: information is scattered across emails, documents, chats, tickets, screenshots, and countless tools — and nobody knows where anything lives.

EKOS uses multimodal AI, retrieval pipelines, and lightweight automations to help teams find answers instantly, understand decisions, and trigger actions across their workspace.

This repository contains the initial structure, design documents, and codebase that will evolve into a fully working prototype over the coming weeks.

What EKOS Is Trying to Solve

Every company today uses 8–12 tools daily — Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Jira, Confluence, Notion, GitHub, and more. Knowledge gets siloed, duplicated, lost, or buried.

EKOS attempts to fix this by providing:

Unified Search: One query box that searches across Drive, Gmail, Slack, Jira, Confluence, PDFs, screenshots — everything.

Multimodal Understanding: Ask EKOS questions based on text, images, screenshots, or meeting audio.

Context-Aware Answers: Instead of a long list of documents, EKOS synthesizes an actual answer with citations.

Knowledge Graph: Automatically links people, documents, decisions, timelines, and tickets.

Action Automation: Generate summaries, create Jira tickets, send Gmail drafts, or build Docs based on AI understanding.

This project is fully experimental and research-driven. The goal right now is to build a working foundation that can scale into a production-grade enterprise assistant.
